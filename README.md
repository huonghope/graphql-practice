Learn Graph QL [Learn GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/validation/)
React + GraphQL + MongoDB


###  GraphQL comes with a set of default scalar types out of the box:
- Int: A signed 32‐bit integer.
- Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value.
- String: A UTF‐8 character sequence.
- Boolean: true or false.
- ID: The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache. The ID type is serialized in the same way as a String; however, defining it as an ID signifies that it is not intended to be human‐readable.
